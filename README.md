# libfqlite

This projet is a fork of the official FQLite tool (https://github.com/pawlaszczyk/fqlite).
This fork was created to adapt the code of FQLite to be better suited to be used as a library by other tools.

If your intention is to use it as a tool to recover deleted records from SQLite databases, chances are that you want to get the official FQLite tool.
